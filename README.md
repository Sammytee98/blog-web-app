## Installation & Setup (Vite)

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Sammytee98/knowledge-vault.git
cd knowledge-vault

npm install

3️⃣ Start the Development Server

npm run dev
Now open http://localhost:5173/ to view the app. (Vite uses port 5173 by default.)

## 🎯 How It Works

1️⃣ Users land on the Home Page, where blog posts are displayed.

2️⃣ The Navigation Bar provides quick access to Home, Posts, and New Post pages.

3️⃣ Users can create a new post using Markdown, including headings, code blocks, lists, and links.

4️⃣ Posts are rendered dynamically, including syntax-highlighted code snippets.

5️⃣ The search bar allows users to quickly find posts.

6️⃣ Users can like, comment, and bookmark posts.

7️⃣ Each post has an edit and delete option.

## 🔗 API & Data Handling

Data Source: The app currently fetches posts from a local JSON file (/posts.json).

State Management: Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) for efficient updates.

Markdown Rendering: Posts support bold, italic, links, lists, and syntax-highlighted code.

## 🌟 Future Improvements

🚀 🔐 User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage profiles.

🚀 📡 Backend Storage: Move from local JSON to a real database (Firebase, MongoDB, or Supabase).

🚀 🖼️ User Profiles & Avatars: Display usernames & avatars on posts.
